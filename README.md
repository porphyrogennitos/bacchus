# Bacchus

Was another name for Dionysus; the Ancient Greek god of wine and festivity. 

This web application lets you add and delete the festivals you've visited in Greece.

## What technologies were used?

Is made in VSCode and written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python (Flask library used) and SQL.

## Installation

I have included a `requirements.txt` so the only thing you have to do is: `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt` ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7225900/how-can-i-install-packages-using-pip-according-to-the-requirements-txt-file-from))

## How to use?

Firstly, you have to register, and to do that, you press the "Εγγραφή" (Eggrafi) button in the homepage. You need to type a correct email and a password (it can have whatever letter and length you want) and then you press again "Εγγραφή". 

TaDa! You know have an account in this magnificent website! Now you'll have to login and to do that, you press "Σύνδεση" (Syndesi) button; type your email and password and "you're in"! 

You'll be redirected to a "complicated" page but don't be daunted! There are two buttons; one with "Πρόσθεσε" (Prosthese, meaning "Add") and the other with "Αφαίρεσε" (Aferese, meaning "delete").

Say you want to add a festival; you press the "Πρόσθεσε" and you have to add the name, the location and/or the date you went. 

If you want to delete a festival, press "Αφαίρεσε" and type exactly the name of the festival you want to be deleted!

Finally, there's a link on left where you can log out.
